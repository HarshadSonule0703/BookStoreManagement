        <h1>About Our Online Bookstore</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to our Online Bookstore â€” a simple and secure platform where customers and sellers can connect for buying and selling books.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project was developed using Advanced Java technologies including <strong>Servlets, JSP, JDBC, and MySQL</strong>. The application supports customer and seller logins, book management, and purchase functionalities.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was designed as a hands-on project to strengthen Java EE skills and learn how to develop full-stack web applications using traditional server-side Java.
        </p>
        <p>
            We aim to keep expanding this platform with new features like book reviews, online payments, and order tracking in future iterations.
        </p>
